8,63348c829133d3432093c8a7,92.76,"Thank you @fatmascara for having me on the pod for the SECOND time 💜 Quick back story - my first time ever doing a podcast was @fatmascara nearly 3 years ago 🙈 I was super shy and nervous, but also extremely honored because it wasn’t until then that I realized people were actually listening!! At the time, I thought maybe my husband was right - I was just some crazy talking to her phone in bed 😂 Well turns out he was wrong and here we are.

This was such a full circle moment ❤️ I had so much fun chatting with @jenn_goldstein and @jessicamatlin about  BS beauty industry claims and regulations, Major Fade, and the journey that brought us here 🙌 

Addressing the 🐘 in the room - how has it become ok for brands to claim “non-toxic” (ie is everything else really going to kill you?) yet addressing a physical sign such as “hyperpigmentation” is a huge no⁉️While yes, it is true that a cosmetic product cannot and should not claim to *treat* hyperpigmentation, the terms that we are left with, like “helps address discoloration”, “brightens” and “glows”, create even greater confusion on the marketplace.

Interested to hear your thoughts below ⬇️ and to join in on the fun, link in bio for the full episode 

P.s. If you wanted to go back to listen to my first episode it’s still up ( Ep. 139 All About Eyes). You can say I’ve popped out of my shell since then 🐣

Never in a million years did I think this would happen, let alone happen in less than 2 days…. Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you…. Just doesn’t do it justice! There are not enough thank you(s) in the world to describe the level of gratitude I have for all of your support, encouragement, and trust in me ❤️

LET’S GOOOOOOO 🚀 
@pillowtalkderm the brand story, how the products works, why I hate meaningless BS sustainable claims, and my gratitude for all of you 
✨ Welcome to the next chapter of PillowtalkDerm 

If you had told me 4 years ago that I would be brave enough to pick myself up from nothing, be capable of using my voice to speak up, have the courage to follow through on my dreams and to top it off, have an army of as obsessed and accepting skin nerds by my side, I would have thought you’re smoking something… 🤷‍♀️

Fast forward to now, and not a day goes by where all of your support, encouragement, questions, stories, willingness to share & listen is lost on me. There will never be enough thank yous for helping me find my way while giving me the chance to help you ❤️

Over the last 2 years, as I was building the skincare, many people told me I should build it as Dr Idriss…And although the story started with me, the reality is it has always been an US story. PillowtalkDerm is more than just another doctor skincare brand… it’s about empowering ourselves through education and each other’s support, to help ourselves have the confidence we deserve 🙌

I’m so excited for this next chapter, and for US to show the beauty industry what it really means to give the people what WE want + deserve 🔥

A year ago today, I opened the (nonexistent) doors to my practice @idrissderm 

The start to my business was a very rocky one, met with bumps, roadblocks, and literally no office. The weeks leading up to the opening, supply chain issues delayed construction, and left me with no office space despite having a full schedule of patients ready to be seen. I felt hopeless and wanted to quit, even before beginning. 

And although I’d like to believe I did not quit because of willpower, the biggest reason I did not quit is because of the support of these amazing people 🥹 We found a temporary space within a week of opening, signed a lease, cleaned it up, had fake walls put up, brought decorations from home and called it a “pop up!” 

It took a village, not just to open, but to get me here today. We rise by lifting others, and without the support of this amazing group and my patients, I would have been at the bottom of a black hole 🤣🤷‍♀️#truth

So thank you - to my husband, my sisters, dr kim, Vanessa, tiffany, Melinda, marie and my veryyy dedicated patients to whom I am grateful for everyday because without you, I wouldn’t be able to  write “WE F*CKING MADE IT TO A YEAR!!!!” 🎉 

Happy one year anniversary @idrissderm 👶

A day late but happy #nationaldaughtersday to this sass filled light of my life. (P.a. She dressed herself and asked me to film her 🤣) 
This space has come such a long way. When we started this project, we had no idea what it would entail. Many many months and several projects later... we're SO glad we now have a multifunctional space where we can work peacefully with the FamilyMade Media team and retreat to as a family. I mean... just look at how beautiful it is!! 😍 Shout out to @sunbrella for making the space complete & perfect in EVERY way. From the dog to the occasional coffee spill, our comfy furniture made with Sunbrella fabric has held up seamlessly (coffee spills wipe RIGHT off). We literally couldn't imagine how it would look now if we hadn't had your help the entire way!! Swipe all the way to see the before 🥴 #SunbrellaPartner

Best video ever? Yes. 😍🥹🤣 
To say I'm obsessed with @caliafitness new collections LustraLux & Powermove would be an understatement. As a gymnast, the fabric and technology in fitness apparel has been important to me. The new LustraLux collection is made to perform the BEST in studio workouts – think yoga, barre, pilates – but with its buttery soft fabric, you will want to LIVE in them. P.s. Calia... thanks for always making this momma feel empowered 😊 #IChooseWhatFits #CALIAPartner

My Moose took his last breathe in my arms today. He was 14 and a half. He was my first baby, my buddy, my protector, my whole heart and the best dog in the world. He ran up to me about a year after I had moved to LA and he has been with me ever since. He helped me grieve the loss of my mum, was there through all the ups and downs, the boyfriends, trips, moving and babies. He was so stubborn, so silly, so loud but so cute and so unbelievably loving. Even the other day I was upset and he struggled to get up and come sit next to me to make me feel better. Always my comfort. Always my friend. The best cuddler, my sweet Moose, I will miss you more than you know. Thank you to @lapofloveveterinaryhospice for allowing me to hold my Moose in his bed till the end. 💫🦋 
Awesome afternoon with @elizabethbanks for @jimmykimmellive 💫 @wendiandnicole @marktownsend1 #makeupbygeorgieeisdell #ElizabethBanks #PressYourLuck 
Never been more excited for summer. The new @chanel.beauty Les Beiges Water-Fresh Complexion and blush are so so beautiful, I am completely obsessed. Amazing color range and so easy to use, incredible for traveling too, no glass and light as a feather. The Healthy Glow Bronzing Cream and Sun-Kissed Powder are perfect too.

I still remember what I was thinking here… “How am I going to do this?”

The pressure was ON… 

I didn’t know much about anything, but I knew it wasn’t about me anymore. I knew that this was going to be one of those pivotal things in my life that would turn me into the man I am today. 

To my gracious baby’s mama @rosemarypascual for giving me this gift, this modern family. I’m am forever grateful. 

To all of our friends and family who supported us, and continue to... I love you. 

To my son @jjordanriley..

Who it’s for: All skin types.

What it does: Blunder Cover is designed to improve the appearance of skin while the all-in-one concealer/foundation evens your skin tone. The formula can be sheered out and used as a natural, comfortable base, or built up as a concealer in areas that need more coverage.

How to use: Gently buff into skin using a face brush or fingertips, building coverage as desired. For a brightening effect, use one shade lighter than your natural skin tone under eyes.

The power of self-care can be felt in many ways, one way being the happiness it brings. My bath time ritual is sacred to me and using products that are designed with my needs in mind makes all those moments even more special. The Opulent Shower Oil from @luxunfiltered is a multi-tasking shower oil that can be used as a body cleanser, shaving oil, or bath drops, allowing you to focus on the intention of your practice. This creamy, hydrating product is infused with jojoba oil, avocado oil & grape seed oil to keep your skin glowy and healthy, while the Tuberose scent, sets the mood and intention for your selfcare ritual. This all in one product reminds me just what an impactful investment into ourselves we should make every day! #luxunfiltered ad 
Don’t neglect your neck. It is so important to think of it as an extension of the face. Make sure to carry your skin care in an upward motion to the neck, including sunscreen to prevent pre-mature aging. 
In my closet: From @dior Fall 22 Collection. ‘Femininity the trap’ t-shirt inspired by @mariagraziachiuri’s strong values, crafted in ecru cotton jersey and linen. #DiorFall22 
I love classic & dainty jewelry pieces that can be worn with every look and some of my absolute favorite jewelry designs come from @debeersforevermark’s Icon Collection. Here they are paired with simple De Beers Forevermark classic diamond studs creating a look that is timeless and elegant. In addition to creating a look you love, it’s important to feel good about the pieces you wear daily.

Fridays are for taking a pause to recenter, tuning in with your body, and re-learning to trust your instincts. 
If you’re a parent like me, you might be wondering what safe, yet effective products to use on your little ones. As our children move away from the baby phase, they also grow out of the products. #ad I discovered the new @aveenokids line designed for kids’ sensitive skin and still developing hair and never looked back! My daughter has been showing more and more interest in being independent in her self-care, so I wanted to choose a product that was hypoallergenic, with ingredients like oat for sensitive skin & scalp. I love using the sensitive skin face & body wash because it gently cleanses without drying & the 2-in-1 hydrating shampoo and conditioner that cleanses, conditions, & detangles leaving her hair soft and manageable. If you're looking for products with the same sensitive formulas that aren't too harsh, this is the perfect product for your big kid! Buy on Amazon! #AveenoKids #SelfCarePlaydate 
This post is dedicated to my little fashionista who inspires me to get up every morning and conquer the world for her. I love you, Kaia. 🤍

All Hail The Woman King

The new King is a Black Woman. The ESSENCE of sisterhood is displayed on our September cover with the cast of The Woman King: Viola Davis, Lashana Lynch, Thuso Mbedu, Sheila Atim, and Adrienne Warren. Here is proof that the power of community and loving with intent prevails in every Kingdom.

""Our togetherness is resistance. We are so much stronger together. I didn't know I had sisters in places. That's how it felt being on this set. My sisters have multiplied. And the beauty in that, and the beauty in what we have learned from each other because of our individual lived experiences, and the beauty that we present when we come together, we present what the world has never seen before. They love, they meaning the system, meaning everything else out there, loves to divide us, because if you divide us, then you can conquer us. Try to penetrate us. You won't because we have been through so much, and because in each and every way, we're not superheroes, we're actually warriors. We're Black women."" — @adriennelwarren #ESSENCE

✈️ I met @diarrhaxo years and years ago at the airport when I worked for @maccosmetics - there was some travel troubles but I wanted to hook a sis up. 
.

💄Fast forward to attending @imatsofficial and all the beauty events we naturally just bumped into each other until we just became friends. Always a vibe. I’ve watched this queen go from Temptu to visiting her on her last day at Loreal and watch her bloom out of Glossier. 
.
.
🔥@byamicole isn’t just another beauty brand - it’s a movement, a celebration of skin, of standing on and in your own and I couldn’t be more honored to help bring this vision to light. So so proud of you!

How to take your own pics…once & for all!!⁣ Pt. 2🤌🏾
⁣⁣
I've always had a love for photography, even before makeup. When I first moved to NYC, I took photography classes before I took makeup ones. ⁣
⁣⁣
Here's  what I learned:⁣
⁣
📸1. Always be facing or adjacent to your light source. Never ever turn your back to the light if you want to be well lit. 
⁣
📸2. You need a tripod. A GOOD one that comes with a remote if you’re using your phone 
⁣
📸3. Watch your backgrounds, it can add or take away from your photo. When taking beauty photos the backgrounds can make the picture stronger. These photos I took I changed my positions to in front of the rocks instead of the wooden deck and it looked way better. So move around and see what works!

Soaking up the last bit of summer at the @postoakuptown hotel in Houston TX (my hometown) My best friend and I spent the day here for Labor Day. I wanted to celebrate her for having a baby & it was her bday. The @postoakuptown did not disappoint! We had a relaxing day at the spa which is Forbes 5 star rated spa & hotel. Then had the most delicious lunch by the pool cabanas. Everything from the food to the drinks was perfection. The customer service was also top tier for me. 🙌🏽 The Post Oak Hotel really went above & beyond to make our stay special. It’s safe to say I’ll be back soon for more relaxation and good vibes.

ANA DE ARMAS X L’OFFICIAL

After conquering Hollywood, in her new Netflix film Blonde, Ana de Armas is taking on her most challenging role yet: the inimitable Marilyn Monroe.

""My job wasn’t to imitate her. I was interested in her feelings, her journey, her insecurities, and her voice, in the sense that she didn’t really have one,” she says.

Blonde follows Monroe from her mother’s fraught care to her life as an orphan, a pinup, and eventually a silver screen icon. At nearly every stage of Monroe’s life, the people who were supposed to care for her would eventually defile her. By showing Monroe in her totality, director Andrew Dominik and de Armas provide a broader perspective of all that Monroe endured.

33,63348c829133d3432093c8c0,80.26,"Tips for improving your drugstore acne treatment:

✅Adapalene is a great topic to start for mild acne and clogged pores, while improving post acne marks 

✅ add in BPO (dynamic duo) if you have inflammatory acne, spot treatment treatments are great to shrink zits more quickly, or chose a BPO cleanser daily if you have more dry and sensitive skin 

✅ Moisturizers are non-negotiable must have for acne skin. Helps to keep your skin barrier healthy and reduce irritation from retinoid and BPO. They do not interfere with your treatment so use as often and as much as you need!!! 

What are your favorite drugstore acne products?

Part 2: hair loss solutions that you can buy OTC that *actually* work.

There are so many OTC treatment options for hair loss, but many of them are ineffective with false claims. However, there are several options with evidence based research to support its efficacy.

These include:
-minoxidil (@rogaine)
-nutraceuticals like @viviscal or @nutrafol 
-low level laser therapy

Stay tuned for part 3 where we cover prescription medication for hair loss, which are even more effective than these OTC options! 

Be sure to like and follow @derm.talk and @dermguru for more educational content related to hair, skin, and nails!

Hair loss!!! Super common, super frustrating, but unfortunately, can be super tricky to manage. There are lots of causes of hair loss, but we have shared the most common ones here.

Most important for effective treatment is knowing the type, identifying contributing factors, and tailoring therapy to appropriately address all of these variables. 

Stay tune for part 2, we will be sharing effective OTC treatments for hair loss

Follow @dermguru and @derm.talk for more practical and useful hair and skincare content!

Calamine lotion with it’s drying properties may provide mattifying effect under makeup but it’s too drying and harsh on face. Instead pick a primer formulated for oily skin that help with shine control and pores! Just products for what they are intended for!

Topical minoxidil is what I most frequently recommend to try over the counter, if you’re experiencing hair loss. Can be helpful for 60% of individuals. Overall low risk of use

✅ pick the cheapest 5% regardless of what the box says. There’s a pink tax for women version but those made for men are exactly the same

✅ pick foam over solution. It’s less irritation, more elegant to use, and doesn’t run down on face as easily.

There are very limited products available when it comes to improving white spots. So I was very ecstatic to learn about @lullage_usa Repigment12, for white patches that was recently launched on the US market. Check out my interview with Dr. Matteo Bordignon, an Italian dermatologist, and learn about his research and science behind this fascinating formulation! 
Microneedling for hair loss has been shown to be beneficial only when combined with topical minoxidil or used in conjunction with PRP injections. Although it’s only been studied as treatment for androgenetic alopecia, it potentially may be helpful for other types of hair, but more studies are needed!!!

👉🏻One thing to keep in mind is that benefits were only see in professional devices not home dermarollers. So if you are interested definitely talk with your dermatologist

Love Microneedling when it’s done properly. Especially for skin of color individuals and those prone to scarring (ie keloid and hypertrophic scars) make sure to see an experienced provider in the appropriate office-setting!

I don’t believe in dupes, but it doesn’t mean there aren’t great and affordable product finds in drugstores! I personally love and use all these 👆🏻! What you choose to use is personal but also depends on your budget! As always use what works best for your skin!!!

I personally believe everyone can use a topical retinoid. Key is selecting the right one for your skin type and easing your way into use.

👉🏻 Literally remove all other products from your routine except cleanser, moisturizer, and sunscreen when you first start off. After you have passed that initial retinization or adjustment phase you can slowly add them back!

👉🏻Highly recommend using a richer and more nourishing moisturizer at night, especially if you have dry skin and is starting a prescription retinoid. 

👉🏻 Start off slowly, consider 2-3 times weekly at most, and gradually add in additional night per week as tolerated until you work up to nightly. Taking a break as needed for few nights if you get dry and flaky!

My mood fluctuates between natural and natural plus.. thankfully @lashify has all the options. Today I tested the differnce between CORE A's and PLUS A's
First eye I used A+10 & A+12 - this one is a bit finer and lighter. 
The second eye I used A10 & A12 - extremely similar but a bit more amplified and present. 
Next time I will try a stacking combo of these for a bit more drama (all still on the natural side)
The verdict - all depends on the mood...but definitely add coffee! 
This is pretty much the exact flow I use when prepping my clients skin before makeup. I would never apply makeup to skin that hasn't been made ""more alive"" with the use of tools and great skincare..
Products listed in order of use..
* @vhskin VH method peel - to get skin completely clean. I thought my skin and neck were clean. But look at the evidence left on this pad! 
* @bioeffectofficial Imprinting Eye Mask
* @bioeffectofficial EGF Serum - I'm obsessed with this serum and especially love it as a massage base
* Korean microcurrent device - sorry I can't give more info - @ziipbeauty and @mynuface also have great microcurrent devices
* @refa_usa Carat Face roller
* @refa_usa CAXA M1 love this one for the eye area
* @lymalife Laser - I could spend an hour just on this, so effective
* @facegym Multi Sclupt - I like to keep this in refrigerator for bonus sculpt
* @joannavargas Magic Glow Wand - I'm using the cold setting to help reduce any puffiness
* @welovecoco @chanel.beauty N. 1 de Chanel Revitalizing Serum in Mist for a nice reset 
* @ritueldefille Thorne Oil
 - obsessed with the rose scent and the rosy glow

The lightest (fake) lash ever. The new PLUS + collection from @lashify takes the styles you already know (A,B,Cs) and added the + by making the base finer and the lashes more delicate. These are the most comfortable and longest wearing lashes available..
* pro note - because these are so delicate pop the lid off the pod to remove the lashes from the cartridge to avoid breakage. I like to lay out my lashmap on this great sticky pad to keep organized. 
I'm wearing A+8  A+10 B+10 B+12
These lashes are the most non fake looking lashes I've ever seen. Truly obsessed.

My top must-have products from my favorite hair wellness brand @vegamour ☀️ Use code MARCUS and save! 
With August being Hair Loss Awareness month, it’s a topic that shouldn’t be taboo but something that gives people an insight into what tricks & resources are out there that can help.

Since it affects so many men and women, especially with life’s stresses, it’s great to know improving hair and scalp health can only help to reduce your hair shedding & to grow out your hair.

Hair follicles get suffocated when the pores have excess exposure to products especially with silicones and synthetic chemicals. When using the @vegamour GRO Hair Serum daily, you’re introducing clean, vegan ingredients to a more balanced scalp to encourage healthier hair.

When your scalp is neglected, it directly traps products & clogs the hair follicles, resulting in hair loss and inflammation. Getting your scalp healthy is one of the first things you can do and with the help of @vegamour GRO Scalp Detoxifying Serum. Massage into your scalp once a week before you shampoo as a part of your new routine.

I’ve had my own issues with hair shedding for several years.  Since adding vegamour to my routine of products that help control that, I’m much happier with how it looks and feels.

Use code “MARCUS” to save 20% at @vegamour.

Guess what guys? It’s Launch Day🖤
Today has been a truly amazing day for us all at OAMSkin. I’m just reflecting on the beautiful Press Event in NYC last week. Getting to meet some of  the industry’s top editors was a such a momentous occasion. We really appreciate all the love and support during our mission to create clinical level skincare for everyone. I’m super proud of the work we are doing, and I’d like to thank the entire OAM team for a job well done!

Anybody who knows me knows that I’m a fanatic when it comes to my skin! Skincare is a huge component in selfcare! At my age,I take every opportunity to preserve the youthfulness of my skin! So OAMskin] has been the perfect solution for radiant, tight and clear skin! And its easy 5 step routine makes it super simple! 

As an OAMskin advisory board member I am so excited to share our secret to luminous and healthy skin! So get ready for that major glow up on September 15th✔️

It was @ciara’s mission to make clinical-level skincare easy for you. Our packaging includes a numbering system (on the bottle and on the box!) to take the guessing game out of the layering order.

Step 1: Wash ➡️ Step 2: Prep ➡️ Step 3: Rejuvenate ➡️ Step 4: Moisturize ➡️ glowing, radiant skin! 🙌

Take a peek at our product highlights to learn more about each product and how to layer each step.

You all know I don’t go anywhere without my concealer and this new @bobbibrown “Skin Full Cover Concealer” is my latest obsession! 

It delivers seamless, featherweight coverage for up to 16 hours and applies easily to the skin with an artistry-inspired, multifaceted doe foot applicator so you get the perfect amount each time! 

I prepped my under eye with Vitamin Enriched Eye Base first to ensure a smooth concealer application and set it with Sheer Finished Pressed Powder. 

The easiest concealer application in just 3 simple steps!

How to look 10 years younger PART 2!

I went back to visit @damoneroberts from Damone Roberts Brows and he shared the best hack! 

He spills the deets with us on how to look younger by growing your brows back thicker & fuller, while also teaching how to grow your lashes longer. 

Brow Gain = “youth in a tube”  is the hack. It’s available in my Amazon storefront (Link in my Bio) under Eyebrows. Or DM me for the direct link. 

We’re dying to know if you knew what brows like Brooke  @brookeshields 
means?! 

Drop a ❤️ if you knew and a 👎 if you had no idea! 

Comment below if you’ve struggled to grow your brows in and we’ll pick one of you to send a brow gain to! 

Definitely share & save this post with anyone who needs this genius hack. 

Be sure to check out PART 1 on how to look younger with an eyebrow lift naturally. 

Follow for more hacks, I’m always sharing ways to make life more fun & easier!

Appreciation Post…
❤️
Try to enjoy time with your loved ones, time flies so fast, it seems more so after a kid.
It feels it was only yesterday she was a baby…..
They say enjoy every moments because they grow so fast and until you have a kid, you don’t actually realize how true that is.
Especially in a business like mine where you feel you have to keep that momentum going all the time.
I was lucky to spend 2 years with her 24/7 due to pandemic.. not easy but in retrospect.. a blessing.
There is no time like the present..
Oh yeah.. and appreciation for a super hot husband.

I've gone thru a lot of suitcases in my years of being a hairdresser and traveling around the world. But this @tumitravel has been with me for 6 years strong and still my favorite to carry all my brushes, irons, and products. The sides expand giving you more space when needed and less when things are tight. It easily glides across floors (even annoying hotel carpets), is well made, and has never cracked or broken (
fingers crossed!) It's lightweight so I'm not paying fees at the airport for a bling-y bag and super easy to clean inside. 
I have the larger size for all my personal items. The gift that's kept on giving. Thank you @mikibauer

I love a low loose braid. Which is your fav? 1-4 

Tip: add a texture spray or hair powder into the mid lengths of your hair to give it grip. Pinch and pull the sides out to create fullness and a loose airy look.

How To:  Apply @Biolage Hydra foaming styler roots to ends on damp hair. Let hair air dry or diffuse for a natural texture. 
Then take a 1 inch iron held horizontal to the head and press 1/2 inch sections. Rotate the iron a half a turn each bend to create soft shallow waves.

I love hairdressers and I love education❤️
Yesterday was such an incredible day with many talented @biolage educators from all over the US! Our first gathering since the pandemic. It was such an honor to be teaching again and see the connections happening in the classes, the ""aha's"" of learning ways to work smarter not harder, and all the tips and trends we get to bring back into the salon and share with our clients. 
I've been a hairdresser for 23 years! Looking back,  I wouldn't be where I am without the mentors and artists that invested in taking the time to teach me. Knowledge is powerful and investing in your education gives you the tools you need to move forward in your career and in life. 
Thank you @biolage for bringing us all the together and for having me! I'm so excited for all that is to come next year and beyond!

What I’ve seen lately is giving me so much hope, the fight is not over but together we can make this change happen. Living in a small remote village in south of France I can’t be part of any big protest or march but still want to support the #blacklivesmatter movement. So here is a link (in the bio) to download those #blm images if you want to spread positivity. I’ve had a lot of request for sharing my late piece of work, I’m not asking any credits for it as again this ain’t about me. Please just share them wisely to the world to fight the oppressors. 
In a crisis you really show your true color they say! Stay Home People so we can get back to doing what we know how to do...I came to water the plants and check on your formulas so when we chat I can help guide you to your true colors...#dowhatyoucan book now for a consultation on my site...gift cards available for that or your next appointment!

They swell and crash. The tide rolls in and we squeal with delight and then just like that it rolls out sometimes with enough strength it can pull you in and down 🌊

I love the ocean and all of its life likeness. Born and raised a Cali girl I’ve always turned to the sea to comfort me. To remind me of the only constant which is change 🌊

I have changed. I can tell you that much. I continue to swell, crash, roll in and out.  Just as my rib cage that expands with my breath, my mind and heart and soul and joy and fear and faith expands and contracts. Swells and crashes…constant 🌊

If you’ve got a spare moment to please send us your positivity and light we will take it. Our beautiful girl has her next scan coming up. We will learn how far we have come. And I can’t wait… 🌊

52,63348c829133d3432093c8d3,16.1,"I needed a gentle reminder to breathe this weekend so I thought you might too. Watch this video by the talented @aolanow ten times and follow her directions. Repeat a few times throughout the day. 💕 #sendinglove #drpapri #askdrpapri 
Want to know my morning sunscreen routine? It changes based on the day and my skin. Here’s my routine from two days ago:

I always try to use two layers of sunscreen and skip makeup under my mask. To hide imperfections, I use a clear sunscreen first and then layer a tinted one on top. Instant SPF coverage without pancake face. 

My first layer is @purito_official Centella Green Level Unscented Sun Blocker SPF50. This chemical sunscreen doesn’t sting my eyes and goes on clear. 

The second is @alastinskincare hydratint. It’s a mineral sunscreen with moderate coverage and has a universal tint that tends to work for most skin types. 

The last image is what it looks like after wearing a mask for half a day. Not foundation level coverage but pretty good for a tinted sunscreen! No filter or other makeup on so you can get a fair assessment.

Want to see more of these? 💕 #drpapri #askdrpapri 

Also, #notanad #notsponsored but the Alastin was gifted! 
Dermatologists need to have the best poker faces. 

But seriously, if your injector isn’t informing you of all the potential side effects, you need to find a new injector. #theymaynotknow 

Tagging some friends who I bet always get this right. I could only tag 20 but there are many more! Does your provider talk to you about the risks of cosmetic procedures and how to mitigate them? 💕 #drpapri #askdrpapri 
Beauty is hard to capture in photos and film. That’s why people have been  trying so hard to do it for so long. Imagine thinking “The sunset is having an off day. That’s why I can’t capture it on a forward facing iPhone camera.” #giveyourselfgrace 💕 #drpapri #askdrpapri 

RP: @thecoolissue 🙌🏽 
Having trouble finding sunscreens that play well under makeup? Here are a few of my favorites. PART ONE. 

These go on sheer, don’t pill and won’t change the color of your favorite foundation. ⭐️ Now there’s no excuse. 😉

List below 👇🏽

@eltamdskincare UV clear SPF 46

@blackgirlsunscreen SPF 30 sheer

@neutrogena Hydroboost SPF 50

Have you tried any of these? What did you think? 💕 #drpapri #askdrpapri 
It’s really tempting to consider the SPF that’s in your makeup as your sunscreen for the day but read below 👇🏽 why that might make you look like a clown (literally.) 

Did you know that in most studies people put on 1/4 to 1/2 of the amount of sunscreen they need to hit the SPF number on their bottle? By those numbers, you’d need 2-4 LAYERS to get to the amount of sun protection you were aiming for. 2-4 layers of foundation? 🤡 Wave good bye to that no makeup look you were going for. 

So what can you do instead? Use a make up friendly layer or two of sunscreen and then put your makeup on top. 

And if you have serious makeup skills, come by to teach me how to do mine! #2022resolutions 💕 #drpapri #askdrpapri 
A gentle reminder from me to you this Valentine’s Day. Swipe through for a few more important ones.

Have dry skin but can't give up hot showers in the winter? Here's a cheat that you can do ONCE IN A WHILE. Don't let them take my #dermatologist card away by doing this every day! And don’t skip step 2! What do you think? #nomoresnow 
#bringtheheat #imisssummer
#nocoldshowers  #drpapri #askdrpapri 
Here’s my explanation of how my patient and I picked which treatments to do for him. Each patient approach really is different and just because this worked for him it may not work for others. Watch to see why it worked for him! Also, I didn’t get to fit it in but he wanted a little evening of his texture so we did one microneedling treatment and he switched around a bit of his already great skincare routine. (He’s very skincare savvy!) lastly, I think he’s a little more close shaven in the after photo so that adds to a bit of the smoothing effect (I can’t take credit for that!) Any questions? What do you think? 💕 #teamworkmakesthedreamwork #drpapri #askdrpapri

@ciara in “The Wolf Cut”
unit by @thewildform 

As soon as I saw this 70’s inspired @tomford leisure suit I knew it was the perfect opportunity to try the notoriously trending #WolfCut which is obviously a marriage between the Shag and the Mullet. I think this glam gave what it needed to give 👀….

What do you all think?

@ciara for the cover of @ebonymagazine 

CiCi and I have been on a 15 year hair journey together to get her hair healthy and long. With the proper use of Wigs and Protective hair styles we have grown her hair out beautifully and  healthy but I also give thanks to the science and quality ingredient in our favorite haircare line @unite_hair 

CiCi’s regular hair regimen includes
- 7seconds Shampoo and Conditioner 
- 7seconds Detangling Leave-in conditioning spray
- Uoil (Argan Oil) 
- Boosta Plus+ Hsir Serum 

After braiding #Ciara ‘s hair for this shoot I applied a few drops of #unite Boosta Plus hair Serum on her scalp between each braid to stimulate hair growth and prevent hair loss. I also use this serum on my braid downs for wig installs. I then encourage my clients to use it daily under there wigs. 

#boostaplushairserum
With daily use, you will see visible results within 90 to 120 days.
Benefits:

•Promote hair growth
•Add density and fullness
•Soothe and nourish the scalp
•Prevent hair loss
•Restore and revitalize follicles
•Add shine and softness
•Free of harsh chemicals 
•Free of harmful side effects
•Daily use on all hair types
•Fragrance-free
•Vegan

The smartest and best way for me to handle her hair was to use my @ilesformula_hair Curl Revive. It was a super hot day, so Margaret’s hair stayed protected and frizz-free, for the wet hair images curl was beautifully formed and for the dry hair images the curl was to die for! big voluptuous and grease free!

By the way, it's the first day of Fall today, and thus the perfect time to be inspired by this beautiful autumn color. The Iles Formula shampoo and conditioner are color safe and the serum protects against UV fade!

Head to @ilesformula_hair for more inspiration

This is the texture @ilesformula_hair delivers, it's the texture that clients often book me to deliver. It was through the need to  deliver  this texture  instantly on all hair types that Iles Formula was born.
These formulas stop breakage from the very first use, they have the power to transform ALL hair types to sumptuous nurtured silk from the very first use. The more damaged hair is the@more phenomenal is the performance. Tap image to read reviews on the Signature Collection .

#ad IT’S SAVE MONEY ON SKINCARE SZN! 🤑

A few times a year I team up with #Paula’sChoice to host a shop event and you guys always tell me you look forward to it. For the next 48 hours (9/12-9/13) via the link in my bio we’re offering: 25% off sitewide + free C5 Super Boost Moisturizer on $75 + free shipping (9/12 - 9/13) 

The C5 Super Boost moisturizer is great gel-cream for all skin types, but I especially recommend this for oily and combo skin types because y’all still need to moisturize despite being oily!!! The consistency isn’t too heavy and filled with great ingredients such as: 2 stable forms of vitamin c to give you antioxidant protection without irritation, hexapeptide-5, polyglutamic blend and a barrier repair lipid blend. 

See the comments for other products from @paulaschoice that I recommend! 
📍got to go to #chicago earlier this year! one of my favorite places 
yes my curls did bounce back 🗽 
@stilazzi blush palettes are the 🐐 
Feel free to drag me 😬 What products do you spot in my collection 👀

I get sent packages every week from brands to try their products in hopes that I like it and will post about it organically. Sometimes I get sent entire collections as an intro the brand. I would say most of the time I don’t like something or I have duplicates and those I give away to my friends & family or I’ll do a large giveaway for social media (maybe for my 300k Twitter giveaway?!)

Getting products is a really cool perk of my job and the amount of brands I have a relationship is a culmination from my 7-year career in the industry. 

Follow @makeupforwomenofcolor 🥰 
one of the best treatment for dark spots is…prescription hydroquinone!

I recommend combining it with a retinol and chemical exfoliant. 

You should use it in a 3 month cycle (3 months on, 3 months off) with other brightening agents like kojic acid, cysteamine, alpha arbutin, tranexamic acid, hexylresorcinol, licorice root, ellagic acid, mulberry & niacinamide 

What are your favorite products & ingredients for dark spots? 
alternative spot treatments…

sulfur spot treatment
benzoyl peroxide
icing
pimple patches
led treatment 
#ad I’m excited to announce that I’m now a part of @EucerinUS’s ambassador network! I grew up using Eucerin and continue to use it to this day so I’m thrilled to be able to share their newest innovations with you all. 
Their Eucerin Intensive Repair Essential Oil Balm is a new product and it does a good job at keeping my skin looking radiant and glowy all day which is key now that the weather is getting warmer and we’re all showing more skin.

My favorite part is that Eucerin is available at tons of retailers so it's easy to pick up and try. Check it out with the link in my bio. #WithYouForLife

59,63348c829133d3432093c8da,12.44,"Goodmorning everyone. 
I wanted to start this week by saying I LOVE YOU ALL!

Last night was the Jewish New Year called: Rosh Hashana which translates to “The Head Of The Year”. 

I have always love the symbolism of this Jewish holiday because it reminds and gives permission to all of us to start new. 
A new beginning, end of summer, release of old and in with the new perspectives. 

Our minds and hearts are so powerful. 
We have the ability to change our realities and the words we feed OURSELVES. 

I wanted to take this morning and wish all of you a beautiful new beginning with no guilt of the past. 

New day, New start, New View.
You are powerful and beautiful, exactly as you are! 

I will be working on this mantra this week. 
“My thoughts can and will change my realities.”

Happy New Year. I love you!

“True love stories never have endings.” —Richard Bach 
@jlo‘s Minimal but Meaningful Wedding Day Mani 🤍 🕊 #nailsbytombachik

White on white on white was the vibe! While Intimate moments and personal details is what made Jennifer’s
custom wedding nails so special. 

We started off with a meticulous manicure using my favorite tools from our newly released Tom Bachik x @tweezerman Ultimate Nail Care Set. 

Next adding just the right amount of length and creating a perfect shape I used @miasecret Extension Gel Tips

Jen is loving milky nails. I love how they give a timeless feel and an elegant twist to a classic French. To create that milky depth in our shade I custom blended 😊 #miasecret gelux white gel polish with Luxury Base and Top gel. 

Now time for the details! Keeping it monochromatic I used #miasecret Gel Paint in ‘Snow White’ and a tiny detail brush adding petite flowers to accent nails and a singular hummingbird (special to her) only on her ring finger. The artwork was kept subtle and barely noticeable accept to those who knew 😉

Finally a sprinkle of Mia Secret’s gelux silver glitter sparkle lightly frosted the tips and flowers on the nails because we’ll, It wouldn’t be JLo without sparkle ✨ 

Lastly to help add to the JLo glow, and she was glowing!, I finished with @welovecoco Chanel L’Huile Camelia Hydrating and Fortifying Oil mixed with a little Le Lift La Crème Main for a cuticle cocktail to help make her cuticles and skin radiate. And that she did🥰❤️ #jloweddingnails

63,63348c829133d3432093c8de,47.68,"Come kick it with me and a friend. We are exploring my favorite spots black-owned businesses in my neighborhood.

I love adventure including trying new restaurants, hanging out with GOOD friends, and talking business strategy with my amazing friends. 

Harlem is a vibe y'all. So much so that I’ve spent almost EVERY good night in New York uptown. But even though I love it I find that many of the places I love aren’t as well known. And that has to change.

We don’t want our favorite places to survive, we want them to THRIVE.

With this in mind and MY DEEP LOVE of my community, I want you to experience Harlem with me and I hope you fall in love with it too.

Straight from LAX to a custom @n4skincare facial by my ride or die @thenatalieaguilar. This boss women has been blessing my skin for over 5 years. It’s hard to describe her craft. She’s an absolute master and one in a billion human being.
For those interested, this is what was on the menu this morning (and promise, there is absolutely ZERO filter in this video):
▫️Radio frequency lifting and tightening therapy.
▫️Lymphatic stimulation and cleansing with Biologique Recherche Silicone gloves.
▫️Steam and extractions.
▫️VIP Oygenating Booster for oxygenating skin cells and glowing skin.
▫️A Visolastine+ hydrating masque with delivery of a real oxygen infusion machine.
▫️CryoStick massage for toning, depuffing, and cooling with a collagen eye treatment.
▫️toning face massage 
Fresh faced and unfiltered. 
We adore you @rennotni ✨

(She got it from her Momma 🤍) 
I’m quoted in Elle magazine’s “The Ultimate Beginner's Guide To All Things Gua Sha”.
And I’m so EXCITED because I love @elleusa ✨ 
Posting link in bio… #guasha #facial 
There is a heat advisory here in LA! ☀️
According to many studies 3 out of 4 people are dehydrated. (Are you?)
Your skin tells you how dehydrated you are - you can almost see it. If you pinch the skin on the back of your hand it should return to normal quickly, if it returns to normal slowly you are dehydrated. Therefore, having a hydrated body means hydrated + plump skin. I can’t stress enough how important hydration is for our skin. Not even a $1,500 cream could help us if we aren’t hydrated internally. 

Our brain notifies us when we are thirsty however many of us will turn to sugary drinks, or caffeinated beverages, to cure our thirst. But the truth is, these beverages only serve to exacerbate the issue further. Adding to the problem, many of us can confuse our brain’s signal for thirst as a need for rest or food. I have been drinking these #Cure packets for a few months now and I love them! Thanks to @cure all of our guests this week will receive an amazing kit to stay hydrated! 
Not an ad, thanks @cure for hooking up our clients this week 🤍 
So happy and excited to have been interviewed by @kiehls Many of their products bring back so many memories for me. Like the time I used to work selling cosmetics, in department stores, while finishing nursing school. Some of their products continue to be my favorites and can never be replaced.

✨Liquid Dermaplaning✨

Good bye peach fuzz!

Meet one of our newest treatments here @n4skincare 

Using @dmkinternational Alkaline wash we can safely dissolve the entire hair down to the root all while brightening the skin with mild exfoliation. After your first treatment, the hair will grow back at its normal rate. As treatments progress, the hair regrowth rate will become slower and the hair will weaken; usually resulting in permanent loss of unwanted hair over a period of time. And it’s painless!
Laser hair removal Does not work on peach fuzz because there is usually no color for the laser to target. Waxing is amazing for the upper lip or brows, but can cause unnecessary inflammation when done to the entire face. Threading is cool but rarely is it done evenly, hairs break and it still causes inflammation. 
 🤍 
How to spot an Esthetician at the beach... 
Oftentimes we see people applying masks to try and make them look pretty. However, some masks can definitely leave demarcation lines. 
Treat skin evenly by applying masks through the hairline and blended through the neck and décolletage -if possible. 
Aesthetician Preeti is masking with @biologique_recherche_usa Vivant mask mixed with baking soda for deep purification. 🤍 
Let’s safely protect our babies ☀️

Q: When should babies start using sunscreen? 
A: Starting at 6 months of age. 
The FDA and the AAP ( American Academy of Pediatrics) recommend keeping newborns and babies, younger than 6 months, out of direct sunlight. Their skin is just too sensitive. 
When it comes to selecting a sunscreen for children 6 months+ we recommend mineral-based sunscreens. Mineral-based sunscreens don’t carry nasty chemicals that can penetrate into their skin. This is why we carry, and recommend, @babobotanicals (we also like @californiababy and @babybum).
Physical sunscreen is mineral-based and forms a barrier on the skin that blocks, or deflects, the sun like zinc oxide and titanium dioxide. These are considered “generally recognized as safe and effective” (GRASE) by the food & drug administration (FDA). This is not and ad.

74,63348c829133d3432093c8e9,57.22,"I shoulda taken more pics of the wonderful @aliciasilverstone when she was in my makeup chair, but… the lighting for photos wasn’t great in the hotel room. I took a lot of fun videos outside during the shoot that I can post just as soon as the clothing line collab of her bestie (recognize him in picture 2?) launches next month. 

I kept her makeup pretty simple, as you can see, but that glowing skin is a great combo of the Yarrow Facial Oil from @ojaiwild and a super thin application of #kosasfoundation. On her lids is @rmsbeauty Eyelights cream to powder shimmery shadow in ‘Flare’, and on her lips and cheeks I kept it easy and simple since we were running around outside in the sun all day for the shoot, and patted on a light touch of @vapourbeauty’s multi-stick called ‘Courtesan’, and then added a little sheer gloss over lips. Did you know Alicia is vegan and into clean beauty? 💝

And for those of you wondering- Alicia is just as great as you’d hope she’d be. Even more so!
🌸🫶🏻💜 
Here we see how skin with makeup on it actually looks- unfiltered. People have pores! 

Have you seen #amandaseyfried in #thedropout on Hulu yet? She’s sooooo goooooooood!! 
Tonight she was soooo goooood to paint on. ILY @mingey. Thanks for letting me do a little something on your beautiful face. 🫶🏻 I’m definitely coming to meet your horse! 

Makeup note: a summer smokey eye can be any combo of shades you feel like experimenting with! 🪞Tonight I used shimmery bold coral-pink, rose gold, and purple on Amanda. 

Play around with any eye shadows you happen to have at home. Blue, turquoise, and greens look great together, pinks and oranges do too. There are so many color combos and shadow-placement options for you to channel your inner child with and let your face be your art project.

I 🖤 painting on this dreamy face. This was @sadiesink_ before leaving for last night’s #strangerthings event.  I decided to have fun with the liner + give it a higher outer edge point of lift-off than what i generally do. I love what it did for her eyes and for the overall look. A little quirky and not so expected. 

Click the link in my bio and scroll to ‘shop my post’ for a breakdown of everything I used on her face (and remember I have a 15% off code for most everything  from @thedetoxmarket) … except for one key product that doesn’t launch until mid next month … this gorgeous cheek color. I can’t wait to show you all of them mid-June. They’re my new favorites. 🖤

Beautiful top knot: @ryanrichman 
Coolest outfit: @mollyddickson 
This is my first bath in my new bathroom + my first time taking a bath in two years, and I planned to make it an extra special experience. I gathered some of my favorite products from @evanhealy -(who is a longtime leader in the field of clean, certified organic, sustainably sourced ingredients, handcrafted, mostly packaged in glass, beauty products, and sold at a lower price point than you’d expect for this quality) and at the last minute decide to film my grand tub-bath experience because they looked so pretty sitting on the edge of the tub. 

Here are the pretty products:

Blue Cactus Body Oil : I have a nearly empty one of these beside the bed that I put on arms and legs, but I got a fresh one for this and squirted maybe a tablespoon worth directly into the water.  The scent blend is one of my faves: blue tansy, sandalwood, sweet ylang ylang. It made the whole bathroom and me smell great for hours.  I really love how Evan formulates, and I’d read over a decade ago, about her sourcing practices (direct from small farms she visits around the world), and have loved her ever since.  Putting the oil directly in the water makes my skin insanely smooth when I get out. Side note:  when I do this, I reach for a towel that’s not white to avoid leaving oil traces on behind. 

Green Tea Clay : I used to reach for this powder mask to stave off or treat breakouts, but I have none right not (hooray). I still love this because it exfoliates, which helps control blackheads and scaley red patches of unknown origin, as well as new hyperpigmentation. Also, I’ve read so much about how great the antioxidant power of green tea is for our skin, and since I don’t drink it (I get too jittery), this is my favorite way to get it in/on myself. $19.95

Rose + Jasmin Facial Tonic: Evan told me ages ago all about her HydroSouls. Notice the spelling; it’s because she refers to these plant waters as the soul of the plant, and extracts them in the most sacred (I almost never use this word) of ways.  CONTINUED BELOW IN COMMENTS AS IG IS RESTRICTING MY WORDINESS HERE: 
A day of press with the loveliest #sadiesink. Isn’t it cool how each photographer captures something so different? After sitting through a lot of interviews with the director and cast, I am really looking forward to seeing this new #darrenaronofsky film, #thewhale. #brendanfraser is Sadie’s dad, and wooooooohhwie it looks incredible. Also- see how on the cover photo- the one you see if you look on my IG grid- her eyes really stand out, but it’s not like I used a bunch of shadow or thick liner to draw attention to them. Instead we chose a thin dark brown line to go along her upper outer lashes and I dragged it along what we call her upper water line. It’s super subtle but makes a big impact.

You can find a breakdown of this light and glowy red carpet look I gave the fabulous #sadiesink for her #thewhale premier by clicking the link in my bio and scrolling down to the ‘shop my posts’. 🤍You’ll find lots of my favorites with discount codes thanks to @thedetoxmarket💗(and note that I shot this little video right after we finished makeup when she still had some glossiness to her lips from the @ziziabotanicals lip balm; I gave them a little blot before she hit the road, as you can see her lips are far more matte in the red carpet pics I posted yesterday.) 
Instead of coming home for the #emmys, I stayed in Toronto for a couple more days of #tiff (the Toronto film festival) because this beauty, #sadiesink, was premiering a very special film that I cannot wait to see called #thewhale. The director + cast are incredible, and I will post lots of bts from the last couple of days tomorrow! ❤️✨ and if you’re like- where do I know her from… let me suggest- #strangerthings.

I came to the #torontofilmfestival with this loveliest of souls, #margaretqualley. We were #workingwithChanel for this event and these are the products I used for this super simple and classic makeup look:

🤍COMPLEXION: #margaretqualley’s makeup looks always begin with a smooth, even, glowing complexion. I applied no 1 de Chanel foundation to the center of her face and blended it with a sponge for an undetectable base. A tiny bit of Le correcteur de Chanel for added under eye coverage. I tapped on a tiny bit of number 10 Poudre Universelle Libre to allow her base to last all night.

I swirled Joues Contrast #602 blush onto her entire cheek and patted onto the high planes of her face Chanel’s Baume Essential in the shade ‘Sculpting’ to add extra luminosity and more dimension 

🤍EYES + BROWS

To accentuate her iconic brow shape, I lightly filled in with Stylo Sourcil Waterproof in ‘Brun Profund’. 

I smudged ‘Nude Eclat’ from Chanel’s Stylo Ombré et Contour all over her lids, added a bit of the ‘Contour Clair’ shade in her crease and blended it out for a bit of added depth + dimension. 

After curling, I applied many coats of Chanel’s Inimitable Black mascara to both her top and bottom lashes. 

🤍 LIPS 
I applied Rouge Allure in ‘rose imperial’ lip stick all over her lips and blotted it a bit for a diffused edge and soft center. #welovecoco 
Makeup hacks that save time + money? Celebrity makeup artist, clean beauty enthusiast, + TCD contributor @kateydenno loves them. Here are some of her faves:

💄 Concealer as foundation – Kosas Revealer Concealer (Katey uses Tone 2)

💄 Bronzer as eyeshadow -Kosas The Sun Show Bronzer (Katey uses ‘Golden Hour’)

💄 Lipstick as blush – MOB Lipstick in fully at-home compostable external packaging (Katey uses M57)

💄 To make your cream blush last longer, set it with powder blush; this is the same idea as setting your foundation with powder to increase the wear-time. (Katey uses Tower 28’s Beach Please Tinted Balms in ‘Happy Hour’ + sets it with RMS Hydra Powder Blush in ‘French Rosé’)

💄 Use your face or body cream to smoothe down hair frizzies – One of Katey’s faves = @pangeaorganics  Lavender and Cardamon Body Lotion

For those who write me saying you’re in your 30’s/40’s/50’s/60’s/70’s and you want to wear a little bit of makeup, and not look like you’re wearing makeup, but don’t know where to start, may I suggest starting with something similar to what you see I’ve put on the face of my long time friend, someone I’ve had the pleasure of working with since the nearly the beginning of my career, the gorgeous  @realrachelroberts. I’ll write a little about some of what I used below, but IG is restricting the amount of text I share, so… I’ve put all of these in a list with links for you, which you’ll find by clicking the link in my bio and scrolling to ‘shop my post’.

SKIN
✨a spritz of a facial mist you love the scent of. Here I used a favorite from @fath.skincare 

✨ well moisturized skin. Here I used a few drops of @ojaiwild Yarrow Facial Oil. It’s great for quelling any inflammation/redness and plays beautifully under makeup because it’s not greasy. 

✨ just a few drops of a foundation if you are unhappy with any discoloration on your skin. Most of us have something- acne or other scarring, inconsistent pigmentation, sun damage, whatever the case may be. Here I used  @iliabeauty True Skin Serum Foundation, applied with a damp @beautyblender, starting in the center of her face so that the perimeter has barely any foundation on it (unless you need a higher level of coverage everywhere, and then use it as you need). 

✨ a touch of concealer, which is a slightly less emollient formulation, which makes it provide more coverage than foundation) under the eyes or wherever you feel you need it. Here I used one from @jilliandempsey. I really like this formula. Often I only use concealer and skip the foundation. And also, often, I skip both and just love the skin I’m in/I’m working on. 

EYES
✨ I used the lightest sheer shimmery here from @athrbeautyco on her lids and then swiped a tiny bit along her lower lash line. 

✨I smudged a brown eyeliner from from @1999.beauty along her upper lashes and smudged it with a little brush so it hardly looks like anything, just a little added dimension along her lash line.

Guess that’s all IG will give me room for. 
It’s nearly move in time for us after 2 years of renovations, and I’m excited to get to show off some of the sustainable options that I use for all things around the house. I have so many more things to show you, and most of them have to do with eliminating plastic- especially single use plastics- from our every day lives. First up is a box of goodness from @packagefreeshop, with an appearance from @stasherbag, @feelingkooshoo + of course, @pangeaorganics, whose products are all over the house.  Oh! One note: I recently shared a great post from @the_cool_down in which they showed off a similar alternative to paper towel/sponge, also calling it a Swedish Dish Cloth, and 5 of you who follow me and live in Sweden wrote to tell me that you’ve always used such things around the house, but had no idea we here in the US had named them after your country. 🙂 Swedes leading the way! #reducereuserecycle #ecofriendlyliving #sustainableliving #sustainablelifestyle #pangeaorganics

76,63348c829133d3432093c8eb,4.0,"Have you tried NURTURE face and body balm yet as a balm cleanser? It can be used on its own or coupled with PURIFY face wash or CLEANSE face and body wash for a double-cleanse. 

You may not need to double cleanse nightly but it can be a great addition to your ritual especially when removing heavier makeup or stubborn sunscreen. 

The oils in NURTURE will also help emulsify excess sebum which makes oil cleansing appropriate for even oily skin types.

To double cleanse, use circular motions to gently massage NURTURE into your skin for about a minute. Give special attention to the hairline and jawline where makeup tends to build up.

Use a warm, damp washcloth followed by a lukewarm rinse to remove the balm. Don’t worry if there is some residue, the second cleanse will remove this.

Keep your skin damp for the second cleanse with PURIFY or CLEANSE. Again, massage the product in for about a minute, covering the same areas. Rinse, pat dry and immediately follow with your LINNÉ treatment products. 
NOURISH lip balm is back and better than ever! Same glorious ingredients just in a slightly updated ratio to prevent the cocoa butter from coming out of temper in transit. Shop your favorite shades today: ATACAMA, LAC ROSE and TEKAPO. More LAGUNA and DENALI dropping early October!

SKIN CYCLE 

Skin-cycling, a trending skincare concept, is truly just a new-fangled term for having a balanced skin care routine.

The crux of skin-cycling is preventing the over use of treatments and giving your skin time to rest and recover. The skin care method was recently popularized on Tik Tok by Whitney Bowe, MD, a New York-based board-certified dermatologist in response to the overuse of products during the pandemic.

At LINNÉ we have a less-is-more philosophy when it comes to the development of our comprehensive formulas. Our hardworking but gentle products are designed to feed the skin, not cause disruption or irritation - which is why you can use RENEW, our retinol alternative, twice a day everyday, not just on “Night 2”.
Supporting the skin in its natural process of recovery and repair is just how we roll. Nevertheless, for your ease and comfort, we created the LINNÉ skin cycling protocol that alternates “treatment nights” and “rest nights”. Let’s start together tonight! Follow along on stories and in the LINNÉ journal.

When conceiving our REPLENISH everywhere oil we wanted to include restorative ingredients for a healthy scalp and lustrous hair. Centuries of anecdotal evidence would suggest there is no better oil for the job than the fruit of Phyllanthus emblica, also known as Amla or Indian gooseberry. 

This plant has an extraordinary history of treating ailments within traditional Chinese, Tibetan, and Ayurvedic medicine systems. Studies to support this evidence further suggests that Amla fruit possess anticancer, anti-inflammatory, and cardio-protective qualities when taken orally.

Applied topically to the hair and scalp, Amla oil soothes the scalp, regulates oil production, prevents dandruff, protects and strengthens the hair cuticle and shaft.

This action is attributed to the rich content of Vitamin C, Vitamin E, antioxidants, all of which contribute to cellular regeneration and promote healthy circulation to the blood vessels in the scalp. The anti-inflammatory and antibacterial properties further promote a healthy environment for skin and hair cells to thrive in a balanced harmony.

To enjoy these benefits, we recommend treating the scalp and hair at least once a month. The oil can be used warm or at room temperature. Start by massaging the oil into the scalp. The massage itself will help promote blood flow. Work additional oil down the shaft of the hair, focusing on brittle ends. Comb through and allow the product to penetrate as time allows. For deeply damaged and dry hair, leave on overnight. Wash hair and style as usual. 

REPLENISH everywhere oil can also be used daily to increase shine and smooth flyaways. To use apply a pump to hands and smooth onto wet or dry hair. Enjoy your glorious glossy strands! 
#didyouknow that sea sponges are actually multicellular organisms that have been on the planet for approximately 750 million years?! They are found in calm, clear waters all over the world and more than 5000 different species have been identified.

Sea sponges have naturally occurring enzymes that inhibit the growth of mildew and mold and make them naturally antibacterial. They’re also hypoallergenic and toxin-free. 

Find one accompanying each order of PURIFY and SCRUB (full size only).

Tune into stories as esthetician and founder of @baldwinlanebeauty @hannahrcuriel answers all your skincare questions! 
Hi again, it’s Jenna, back to continue our “meet the founder” series. Today we thought we’d give you a little insight into my background and experience. 

My journey to LINNÉ has been a winding road. This I attribute to being a highly curious, and adventurous student who has been guided by extraordinary mentors in a range of fields from permaculture and plant propagation, to philosophy and physics.My studies in environmental science, botany, herbal medicine and dance however have had the greatest impact on the formation of LINNÉ. 

My father, a surgeon and professor of medicine, and my mother a  talented cook and esthete, too had an early influence and I could often be found in the kitchen experimenting with fresh produce to make salutary culinary dishes. Even as a young girl, I was inspired by the Hipporcratic axiom, “Let Thy Food Be Thy Medicine”. 

By the age 10, influenced by my mothers self-care ritual, I began adding simple face masks to my creative repertoire. I used kitchen staples such as apples, honey and cucumber to make delightful treatments for my mother and younger sister. I studied the ingredient glossaries of natural skincare manuals and loved discovering ingredients like tulsi (here pictured) that had medicinal, culinary and cosmetic uses.

This interest in healthy lifestyle eventually led me to Middlebury College in Vermont where I was involved in various sustainability and ecological initiatives, including campaigning for carbon reduction, maintaining the organic vegetable garden and studying plant-based remedies with a local herbal medicine doctor. While always a student of science I ultimately graduated with a BA in studio art, as I found this medium the best place for me to integrate all my new learnings.

I love hearing from my clients and friends about which of my products they like best. Are you more of a Retinol Reform or Lactic Acid fan? Drop your pick down below. 
I taught my sweet Lenny well!  Sunscreen everyday no matter what the weather is. ✨ 
It’s just like Christmas…. in September! My Ultimate Glow Holiday Kit is now available. Included in the set are my Retinol Reform, travel size versions of my Lactic Acid Exfoliating Serum, and Intensive Eye Renewal Cream perfect for keeping your skin glowing during holiday festivities and travel. 
What an incredible night celebrating the @sephora online launch of my Déesse PRO LED Light Mask! Hosting an intimate dinner at my home for some of my favorite beauty and skin care experts to mark this important milestone was really special and a night I’ll never forget. ♥️ I’m beyond grateful to @sephora for sharing my Déesse mask with their community, and to this amazing group for coming out to celebrate this special time. 
Nothing makes me happier than seeing my products on your skincare shelves. ♥️ I spend so much time and love formulating each and every product so to see how much you enjoy them truly makes my day! 
I get so many questions about using vitamin C and retinol and whether or not you should alternate them. I always suggest to my clients to use vitamin C during the day to protect the skin and to use retinol at night while skin is in repair mode for the best results. 
It’s wild how quickly this year has gone by and how the holiday’s are just right around the corner. I am so excited that my Sculpt and Firm Holiday Travel Set is now available online at @sephora. It includes travel sizes of my Retinol Reform, my Intensive Eye Renewal Cream, Lactic Acid Serum, Hydra Prep Gel, and Facial Sculpting Wand, all in this chic carrying case. 
My longtime client @misabellapatt came to me with gorgeous skin, but has concerns about acne scars from blemishes she’s had in the past. After starting her on my Retinol Reform and consistent facials, she’s noticed a huge difference in the texture and overall tone of her skin. The combination of a great at-home routine and regular facials are so important, that’s why I curate a special routine for all of my clients. #skinbyshani 
Nothing better than a selfcare Sunday in bed watching movies with my Lenny. ♥️ 
Happy birthday to my beautiful angel P! It feels like just yesterday that I brought you home, and here we are 14 years later. You are one of the most sweet and compassionate people, and are wise beyond your years. You are the most amazing daughter and best big sister. I am so proud to be your mom, you make me a better person everyday and I love you so much! Happy birthday my sweet Phoenix.♥️♥️♥️ 
My darling @caitlyn.fruehauf has gorgeous skin, but wanted to work on achieving that overall glow and skin balance when she sees me. For her Signature Facial, I double cleansed her skin with my gentle cleanser and followed with a vibration therapy treatment to help with firming and plumping. I then gave her a lactic peel with a touch of glycolic acid mixed in to resurface her skin and give that immediate glow. I finished her off with some micro-current to give her sculpted cheekbones and a lift. ✨

Asking all Lashies: did you know you get a second chance during the removal of the lifting solution to give your client the lift of a lifetime !? 🙌🏼
If your timing was spot on, you will notice, as you remove the solution, the lashes shifting on the shield like cooked spaghetti .. You’ve hit your sweet spot 👏🏼 
This is you time to make your lash lift shine ✨ Reposition any lashes that have lifted off the shield, further smoothing and separating them into a firm lifted position, ready to be set. #happylifting 🏋🏼‍♀️

When we were taking these images of the incredibly beautiful, smart and courageous @mskataluna (who not only happens to be the 1st Trans Miss USA contestant but also the sweetest, most grounded woman), myself and my sister @miyakemakeup shed a tear watching the images come in on the monitor knowing that these images would one day be in every @ultabeauty store in the USA. Knowing that’s these images of Kataluna would be used as an example of beauty to the world. That young people could see these images, see themselves and see how beautiful they are too. Thank you Kataluna for sharing your beauty and your light with us and for showing the world what real beauty is 💖

I’m reminded of the one time I went to Roland Garros to see him play and the match got rained ☔️ out shortly after it started!  It was such a bummer, but as fate should have it, I got booked to work with him for this shoot and had the best time. 🤩 Thank you @cynthiahadden ! 🙏🏼😘♥️
I’ll never forget how relaxed he made me feel while I was cutting his hair 💇🏻‍♂️…and how kind and friendly he was to everyone. So sad 😭 to see him retire from the 🎾 tour 🎾 but look forward to what is to come! Thank you for the countless memories Roger!!!! To new beginnings! ✨🥂✨

Went to Nashville. Didn’t buy a hat. 
My friend @lisaaharon made my 12 year old self dream come true and took me to meet my first crush, Nick Rhodes from @duranduran at the Hollywood Bowl! Emmys week is always exciting, but nothing will be able to compare to this:) They we’re the first band I ever saw live, back in 1982, and they did not disappoint! They sang all their old songs and I got to go to the after party and meet them in person:) They we’re so kind and I even ran into my dear friend and client, @lorimajewski , music journalist(dream job), radio show host and friend of the band. Who was your first guitar hero? 
Just so beautiful and glowing! ❤️ 
It was true love the moment we met. Glowing sister friend. Xx 
Those eyes just kill me:) Beautiful and the kindest most thoughtful friend. 
This charming man and my dear glowing friend! 
My dream girl @arianadebose ❤️ and her perfect skin!

Shop our best selling eye cream at DrLaraDevgan.com and treat the crows feet carefully at the points of the orbicularis oculi muscle that will avoid impingement on the zygomaticus major and minor muscles of the smile. #beautyisinthedetails #devganoptimization #facialoptimization #boardcertifiedplasticsurgeon

STUART WEITZMAN FALL 2022 @stuartweitzman #STANDSTRONG

A letter to my younger self: Trust your instincts. Keep your ideals high. In life and in surgery, never let the sun rise or set on a problem. Life is made up of a series of many tiny decisions, and beauty really is in the details, so do the right thing, not the easy thing. Don’t be afraid to break glass ceilings or blaze uncharted trails, in the boardroom or the operating room. Even in the face of challenges, advocate for those who need help, and always stand strong. 
“ONE OF THE MOST COVETED BEAUTY ITEMS ONE CAN OWN” 👄👄👄 @drlaradevgan Platinum Lip Plump reviewed in the inaugural @whowhatwear “Deep Review” series— a beauty lover’s deep dive on best in class products in niche categories. This is one of my favorite things that has ever been written about our cult favorite product. I’m so honored that my cult favorite product has graced so many lips around the world. ❤️ Shop online at DrLaraDevgan.com @drlaradevgan #sciencemeetsbeauty #platinumlipplump #planetlipplump #lips #lipplumper 
“This will be one of the few that I continue to use...I loved that it wasn’t too uncomfortable on the lips, the plump was subtle, and it also felt like a high quality skincare routine product.” -Natalia Sztyk. 

Thank you Natalia and @whowhatwear for featuring my Platinum Lip Plump. 💋💋💋

I’m so excited to announce that TODAY is the OFFICIAL LAUNCH DAY to shop ALL @lemme products 🛍 

My moms still in town with me since I’m still recovering from my accident in July, so I decided to bring her with me on a housecall I was going  to be doing for @kourtneykardash 💕 If y’all know my mom, you know she’s all up in the social world and a chatter box… so I made her stay in the car lol 😝 
Kourt was so cute and made me one of her special matcha green teas and OMG it was SO GOOD! I said “my moms gonna be so jealous!!!” So they made my mama one too and brought it out to her to enjoy 🍵💕💕💕

Came by the KBB brow house in Beverly Hills today to SURRRPPRRIISEEEE these cute brow babes because On Tuesdays we TRAIN!!!!! Unfortunately I’m still out recovering from knee surgery, but I’ve had my amazing senior stylist @browsbykim holding down the fort, teaching our fab trainees @specialtybeautyspa & @browsbyadig who came down from Modesto today! 

It was fun to hear them squeal with excitement, & to see their big smiles when I snuck in to say hi in the middle of their hands on training! They were the cutest 💓💓💓

So proud & thankful for my killer kbb team @natkbb @browsbykim @kbbjana @blackdiamondbree 💓💓💓

KBB happens everyday because all of you! Love you, appreciate you,  cherish you, & thank you 💓

There’s still a few dates left with Kim to train which I highly recommend (and is almost half the price of a training day with me!)

Mondays mood: biiiissssshhh please 👋 I feel just like the fabulous @bretmanrock ❤️BUT unfortunately most of my brows would wipe off due to being a cool 90’s kid! Who here has brows left to rub 😜

If you are trying to grow your brows back you need to try our fabulous brow serum! It’ll definitely bring hairs back and create extra fluff

Hand Luggage packing only for 10 days in NYC…& 30 plus outfit options!!!🔥🔥🔥

Tips:
1) try on what you are packing, you want to make sure everything you pack you feel great in (also check weather before you leave)
2) the trick is to get a many outfits as possible using less pieces. This is where your classic items really come into their own. 
3) aim to create looks where you can change one piece, aka shoes or accessories in order to take a look from casual to more dressed up.
4) keep to a few Colors so you can easily interchange your pieces and everything will still go together.
5) pack socks inside shoes, stuff bags inside of bags

For ten days in New York I was able to create over 30 possible outfits depending on my mood and for every occasion.

I think of this like a recipe in order to mix and match, and so my recipe consists of:

▶️ 3 pairs of shoes, two flat (@hermes Oran sandals), one black, one tan and one more dressy @manoloblahnik yet comfortable heels.

▶️ 3 pairs of shorts, one black linen short, one ecru linen shirt and one pair of cycling shorts, all @hm

▶️ 2 bags, one black @dragon.diffusion mini triple jump, one tan @cosstores crossbody

▶️ 6 dresses, a mix of cotton pieces because I knew it would be hot, from @hm and @cosstores and one silk slip dress @onequince 

▶️ one pair of ecru linen trousers @hm 

▶️ 5 Tops, 2 linen shirts, one white long sleeved @zara and one black sleeveless @hm 2 tank tops one black one tan also H&M and one classic white tee from @andotherstories 

▶️ two belts, one tan one black both from Andersons bought on @netaporter 

▶️ 2 pairs of sunglasses, one tortoise shell and one black both @prada

Glitter crusted eyeliner… 

as someone who loves wearing all black (A Lot) especially for evenings out, I love to add a bit of decoration in the form of glitter. 

This feels more like eye jewelry to me and I love that make up can elevate an outfit that way, the exact same way an accessory would.

This glitter gel is by @lemonhead.la and it’s called paradise cove.

Inside my travel vanity case 💄🧴✈️

I LOVE an old school vanity case for traveling and I have this set up to go at a moments notice, everything from skincare, haircare toiletries and makeup!

The case is from @cloth_and_paper and the palettes I use to streamline my makeup are from @artistkitcompany 

WHere possible I buy my tried and trusted faves in miniature form, but I love to depot things into @mujiusa bottles or the @artistkitcompany palettes to save space, make edits and carry more without the weight.

My main tip is to try making makeup looks out of your travel bag before you travel. I can make so many looks with everything in here but it’s not overwhelming.

What are your travel beauty essentials?

It’s it’s ma birthday!!! 🎉

I made an executive decision at the beginning of this year to really prioritize celebrating my birth day in style every year and buy myself special gifts, give myself luxury trips and adventures.

This year has been a huge year of coming into my own, self forgiveness, loving the skin I’m in and owning my uniqueness so I love that I get to celebrate that properly. 

Not that any of us need a reason to celebrate or a designated day, (that can happen any time) but it is nice to take a moment and recognize our growth.

So this year we went to Mexico City and ate allllll the food! Drank alllll the wine! Had massages and spent time wandering around this beautiful city. Will share some personal faves soon!

A look at our press event yesterday with @Honeywell! I was very excited to introduce @Fekkai’s Green Aerosols Collection. My mission for FEKKAI today is very simple. To shatter the myth that clean products are less performative. My challenge to myself and my team every day is to be the pioneers and lead the clean hair industry with high-performance #haircare and #styling products that are clean, #vegan, and #sustainable.

I’ve wanted to launch a collection that treats blonde hair for the longest time! And it’s finally here— @Fekkai Blonde Rx Collection instantly tones, brightens, and repairs blonde hair. These products contain the best natural ingredients that fight off unwanted brassy tones. 

🟣Blonde Rx Purple Shampoo: made with ultra-violet pigments that neutralize brass and charcoal powder to draw out impurities from the hair. 

🟣Blonde Rx Purple Mask: nourishing avocado, jojoba, and chia seed oil boosts shine, strengthens hair, and prevents breakage. 

🟣Blonde Rx Brightening Oil: powered by artichoke leaf extracts, it shields against environmental & chemical damage for smooth, frizz-free hair.

A very good shave is a very simple shave (and it only takes five minutes). My trick is to prepare the skin with hot water; this will loosen up the hair follicle for a more seamless shave. After I massage my skin with @BastideOfficial Miel de Lavande Body Wash, it's a natural alternative to shaving gel and smells divine! It's made with Provence olive oil and coconut oil, that's gentle and moisturizing for sensitive skin.

It’s been incredible to see so many people love it but since 2019 we have seen dozens of brands launch lookalike items. We kept asking ourselves, what is the future of hair waving? This style is here to stay but how can we improve? We read through thousands of reviews and listened to the feedback from our community which led us here. BABE WAVES X.

Posted @withrepost • @houshmandmd Did you know your microbiome affects your skin and hair health?
🥼check out my publication in @practicalderm in my stories❤️

🧠🖥Everyone asks #dermatologists how to take care of their skin!?but do you know your gut health can affect how you look and age ?  Pass the kale ? 🥬🥦🥕🍒
.
📱The microbiome is the aggregate of all bacteria, fungi, and viruses that live on and in us. 

🥼Human microbiome is an important area of research!
.
🔬A recent study (👉🏻swipe) describes a machine-learning algorithm which uses the human microbiome to predict age.
.
🖥The skin microbiome is more accurate than the one of the gut and of the mouth and can pinpoint a subject’s age to within 4 years, on average.
.
🔬The authors also observe that during the composition of the microbiome changes with age and suggest that one day we could use microbiome-targeted therapeutic strategies to prevent aging! 
. 
So make sure to discuss your antiaging and microbiome with your #boardcertifieddermatologist as part of your overall hair and skin goals!

Did you know that your hair changes as you get older?
Hair miniaturization happens to everyone!
Grey hair happens . It can start as early as your 20’s -30’s (NO YOU ARE NOT THE ONLY ONE!)
You can’t halt aging, but exercise, healthy diet and stress management can help.

Don’t forget as hair ages it needs moisture (and occasionally protein) now more than ever.

.
.A lot of you have asked me what to do about grey hairs. I’ve been investigating for you and please if anyone has tried or has tips, share your thoughts/advice/experiences below ❤️🥰✨.

🍓Do you have kp aka strawberry skin or chicken skin ?
Thank you to @skincare and @_genesisabigail for discussing this common topic and including me ⭐️

Keratosis Pilaris is very common and is not acne.

Keratosis Pilaris is a frustrating but not contagious skin condition.
It describes the buildup of keratin (protein) around hair follicles which can result in bumpy and rough patches of skin.
This causes small, raised bumps to form on the arms, thighs, cheeks and buttocks.

The reason for buildup of keratin is unknown, but often occurs alongside other skin conditions such as dermatitis and eczema.
Where these are present avoid scratching, picking, and popping

How long will it last?
Good news is that the condition is not contagious and is thought to have a genetic component.
The bad news is that it can last for years
It is thought to be associated with dry skin or dry skin conditions such as atopic dermatitis.
Treat the skin by using AHA/BHA such as glycolic, lactic and salicylic to help exfoliate the skin.

Some of the most common requests for beautiful skin are for skin brightening, wrinkles, and overall skin health.

My top two key skin ingredients are 🧡🧡Vitamin C and Retinol. 

Vitamin C is one of my favorite ingredients for skin brightening and retinol helps skin cells to turn over this naturally slows down with aging. 

This is a great combination when used properly.

It has been over 2 years to be live and it was wonderful to see so many of my friends and colleagues !

I headed to a  #NYFW party cohosted by @voguemagazine and @merzaesthetics

Then I headed to the  @voguemagazine party . Amazing fashion, music, and people watching!

Dandruff vs. Dry Scalp

🥼Dandruff is the term for flakes of skin, dried oil, and build-up on your scalp.
In comparison, a dry scalp is one that has very little oil on it.
Sometimes the two conditions are connected, but not always.
Dandruff is very common.
You are not alone, and it can be treated but not cured.
The cause of dandruff can be multifactorial.
It is NOT Contagious!

❓WHAT IS Seborrheic Dermatitis

Seborrheic Dermatitis, aka dandruff, most commonly is associated with an oily scalp, greasy scale, and itching.
Dandruff can be the result of a yeast Malassezia.
This yeast is thought to contribute to dandruff in some people because it produces oleic acid, a fatty acid that can irritate the skin and cause flakes

🧴TREATMENTS

Common treatment of dandruff requires using a medication anti-dandruff shampoo.
Active ingredients like Zinc pyrithione & selenium sulfide help with the yeast malassezia
Salicylic acid & tar can help remove dead skin and sebum buildup.

⭐️Treatment Tips:
✨Leave shampoo on for 5 minutes, and use 2-3x weekly. These can be drying so use a conditioner afterwards.

✨For those with dry, sensitive scalp, I recommend alternating your dandruff shampoo with a mild sulfate free shampoo

✨If your scalp is not improving, you may need a prescription. See your dermatologist to determine the cause

1) bring down the temperature scalding hot water is too damaging for skin barrier on your scalp and skin and your hair
2) Don’t tug or pull your hair when wet especially with heavy towels 
3) try a microfiber towel for less pull and damage

Duet with @nola_hand_surgery. There are lots of causes for bumps on the fingers, and derms and hand surgeons can help you figure it out. That sac is representative of an epidermal inclusion cyst and should be completely excised to prevent recurrence. 
In this particular video, this person gets a red reaction from pressure that is applied to her skin. This can be a variant of urticaria, like pressure urticaria or dermatographism. I still thought it was a good opportunity to discuss facial irritation from beard contact 🧔🏻‍♂️

Thank you for sharing @andreventurrr 🙏🏻 
I was informed that there is a small tradition in Filipino culture to wash your face with your first period blood for clear skin. This seems very interesting but playing with microflora from bodily fluids in that region is risky. Additionally, we don’t have evidence to show its effectiveness. We know PRP (platelet-rich plasma) is effective and safe! 
Friendly reminder to check your bed when you stay at a hotel 😅🐜 a helpful clue with bug bites is seeing them in clusters (usually 3-4) and we like to call this “breakfast, lunch, and dinner”. Symptoms can be treated with cortisone creams and antihistamines, but the best treatment is getting rid of the bugs. If you’re not sure if you have bed bugs in your house, your local exterminator can help you out.

#philosophypartner I get asked every day how to treat enlarged pores. This is a simple and gentle duo to incorporate into your routine.
How to use:
- Pump and apply the cleanser to a damp face
- Massage for 30-60 seconds
- Rinse and follow with serum
- Apply 1-2 pumps on clear, dry face 
- Press gently into skin
- Follow with moisturizer in the evening or sunscreen in the morning

This is my rant of 2022. I don’t know where it’s coming from but the misinformation around sunscreen is rampant. As I mentioned in the video, I consider myself to be super open to alternative approaches to health and healing, but I revolve my practice around science and evidence-based medicine to provide proven effective and safe care for my patients. 

People are talking about benzene as cancer causing. Benzene is linked to leukemia but it’s not even a sunscreen ingredient — it was a manufacturing contaminant that was found in a group of sunscreens and those brands are working to figure out what happened. Unfortunately benzene exposure can also happen with gasoline fumes, car exhausts, and pollutants from certain factories, among others. Then people also talk about chemical sunscreens causing cancer. Unfortunately, there haven’t been any studies to prove this. There are studies with certain chemical sunscreens and links to endocrine disruption (still questionable because of dosage), and those ingredients are getting phased out of sunscreens, like oxybenzone. 
There can be many causes and many times it can be unexplained. But I wanted to bring attention because it’s helpful to first know and address the cause before treating it. There was a trend on tiktok to use glycolic acid, and I’ve seen it cause further irritation in people. 
#LaRochePosayPartner Whether you feel like my singing was awkward or not, know that you are not alone when it comes to dealing with acne. When it comes to figuring out where to start, @larocheposayusa’s got you covered with their effective range of acne treatments.

There is an established link between polymorphisms in alcohol dehydrogenase and aldehyde dehydrogenase and aerodigestive tract cancer, notably esophageal cancer. If you have Asian flush, I wouldn’t let this scare you. There are still other factors that play a role in cancer formation, including smoking and diet. But this is just something to keep in mind.

96,63348c829133d3432093c8ff,43.77,"There are few ingredients I think that are truly necessary in a skincare routine and vitamin C is one of them.

One of the most frustrating things however is finding a vitamin C that is effective but doesn’t irritate or breakout your skin!

First off shout out to @firstaidbeauty for continuing to create products that support sensitive skin and sponsoring this post! #fabpartner

Vitamin C notoriously has a strong smell and slightly sticky greasy feeling. The new @firstaidbeauty 10% Brightening Serum combats all of that!

Their 10% serum uses an effective concentration of stable vitamin C which is lightweight, odorless, and safe for sensitive skin!

Vitamin C Benefits include:
✅ Antioxidant to collect environmental free radicals
✅ Stabilize and boost collagen production
✅ Even skin texture and tone
✅ Help fade hyperpigmentation
✅ Hydrate the skin

The amount of benefit you get from vitamin C makes it too good to not be used even if you have sensitive skin!

Is it too late for you to start a skincare routine?

The answer is no! 

Many times we get the majority of our sun damage in our youth and teens. It’s easy to feel discouraged and think you won’t get much benefit from a skincare routine but that’s not true! 

Sun damage is cumulative and it’s so important to get in the habit of daily sun protection! It will limit your chance of skin cancer, dark spots, wrinkles, and poor texture. 

We have plenty of devices to help reverse and improve sun damage including laser devices, microneedling, peels, and more! Talk to your doctor about your options!

It’s never too late to start 🙌

Do you use Hyaluronic Acid?

Hyaluronic acid is a great addition for practically all skincare routines! The beauty of HA is it’s ability to deeply hydrate the skin by attracting and pooling in water ! The other benefit of Hyaluronic Acid is that it plays well with other ingredients and means you can easily add it into your routine!

Two of my favorite @lorealparis HA serums include the Pure Hyaluronic Acid Serum and the l Hyaluronic Acid + Caffeine Eye Serum. I use the eye serum primarily for when the skin around my eyes feels dull and dry!

Join me tomorrow with @wendyskin @lorealparis and @walmart while we chat all things HA! 2PM PT // 5PM ET 🙌 Link in story to sign up‼️ #LorealParisPartner

Here are my 2 tips to layer your skincare to avoid pilling! 

1. Layer your skincare thinnest to thickest in terms of consistency. Cleanser➡️toners➡️serum➡️creams➡️oils

2. Let your products fully absorb/dry before layering the next product! This will allow the products to sit will upon each other and not pill! 

Extra tip: Try to limit your routine to 5-6 steps or less. When you add so many ingredients and products on top of each other they can feel too heavy and clump up.

Tips to limit back acne and Folliculitis 

I notice more cases of back acne and especially folliculitis (infected/inflamed hair follicles) in the summertime! 

1. Take off sweaty clothes as soon as you can! Especially if it’s tight clothing. You don’t want to trap sweat and bacteria on the skin for prolonged periods. 

2. Shower ASAP after excessive sweating or exercise! 

3. Incorporate benzoyl peroxide wash into your shower routine! Benzoyl peroxide is antibacterial and anti-inflammatory. Aim for 5-10% benzoyl peroxide, leave it on for 2-3mins and dry off with a white towel as it can bleach darker fabrics if not washed off completely! 

Most importantly continue to workout, eat healthy, and take care of your mind and body ❤️

Vacation skincare routine! 

Truthfully my skincare routine doesn’t change much on vacation other than increasing the frequency of antioxidants and sunscreen! 

✅ Vitamin C twice a day
✅ EltaMD skin recovery serum at night 
✅ Still use my retinol at night 
✅Reapply sunscreen every 1hr 

I love my sunny vacations which means I don’t just stay inside! Enjoy the outdoors, beach, and pool, and just stay protected with your sunscreen, sunglasses, & hats 🙌🙌

Stopping your treatment too soon! 

This is such a common mistake I see people make when treating their acne! Once they see the desired improvement they go cold turkey and then break out again! 

When you get on your acne routine stay on it for months until it the acne clears or you get the desired clearance. Once you are clear for several months-year slowly decrease the frequency of some of the products after talking to your doctor! 

The goal of many of your treatments is not only to treat acne but to also prevent new acne formation! 

Hope this helps! 🙏

3 Exfoliation Mistakes! ❌❌❌

❌Combining your exfoliants with retinol! This is a sure way of causing skin irritation, redness, and dry skin! ✅Combine your retinol and exfoliants with hydrating ingredients like moisturizer or Hyaluronic acid. 

❌ Exfoliating daily!
✅ Limit exfoliation to 1-2x a week to get the benefits of your exfoliation without damaging your skin barrier! 

❌Trying to exfoliate dry skin! 
✅ If your skin is dry and irritated, this is a sign to hydrate and nourish your skin barrier! 

Exfoliation is a great way to brighten your skin, improve texture, decrease hyperpigmentation, and boost collagen if used properly! 🙌🙌

Pimple patches have become a constant accessory in the past few years with mask use and acne breakouts!

I use them for several reasons⬇️

1. It prevents me from attacking my own skin and pop my pimples (yes, I am human too)

2. It helps absorb much of the pus/fluid that is excreted from the skin

3. The right patch can treat the underlying pimple

The @idewcare Timeout Blemish Patches contain ✅salicylic acid and ✅tea tree oil to treat the underlying pimple! #idewcarepartner #ad

What makes @idewcare Patches different:⬇️

1. Different patches for different areas on the face (chin, cheeks, plus size, original)

2. Multiple patches per box (36 patches for original and plus)

3. Opaque to clear finish which blends well on the skin and does not appear obvious!

Saving my history spiral on French Pharmacies for next week 🫠

As a founder of greasy girl summer™️ 🫠 the most exciting thing about French skincare is the focus on barrier repair (hi really occlusive ointment like products) followed by sunscreens that are *stunning* on application. Oh and the arbitrage happening right now… not great from an economic longevity standpoint but it’s … well not bad from a short term skincare purchasing perspective.

Nothing fancy but that’s the point of not only French Pharmacy skincare but your routine overall 🫠

Also had to just edit in @joycedeezy grunting ‘yeah’ at me in French and general joy after a skincare shop. @dieuxskin is truly a joy 😭😭😭

Ever wonder why the US is behind on sunscreen? Why sunscreen has better coverage and protection abroad? Why certain SPFs don’t burn your eyes? The best SPFs for you? Keep swiping. Could have made this 100 slides so here are some of the things I like to think about when talking #sunscreen.

* typo slide 5: dirrty was a top charting song in 2002 💃 * also South America isn’t a country but a region a typo meant to put alongside Europe! * 
A gentle reminder that people are… people. Taboo subjects that shouldn’t be taboo… that’s what we talk about here. Whether it’s sunscreen, regulations, beauty standards or what’s happening politically (which impacts all aforementioned subjects)… we talk about it. Why? Because we want better. I do at least.

Have been feeling like an Edvard Munch painting as of late and getting messages like this unfortunately is common when you’re a woman on the internet with opinions (this is a more polite dm). But, nothing lives in a vacuum. It’s silly to tell someone to stick to anything. 

While I’m always going to wax poetic on skincare (yes more French pharmacy hauls are coming as I’ve finally finished some products, if you’re there RN eucerin urea 10% body lotion and Vichy capital soleil my lord, so good), I’m also not going to ‘stick’ to anything. 

Everything is connected. 

Happy skincare buying! 🥰

A short list of things that make me mad — no, it’s not an influencer’s video from 2 years ago #MahsaAmini #jacksonmississippi #arizona 
Just because something is new doesn’t make it better. Glycerin does the same thing, it’s just not marketed as well.

Snails on treadmills aside (I’ve never seen the farming so can’t speak to conditions apparently they just crawl around)… why? 

Glycerin exists. Glycerin is GOAT. Tried and true. Humectants or hydrating agents are lovely, but until it’s at the level of glycerin I’m not going to tell you you need it.

*if you love your snail 🐌 products carry on, corsx has a pretty amazing moisturizer but imo glycerin is more researched and I’m not telling people they NEED to have it *

Your reminder that unless someone provides receipts… they’re just someone commenting on the internet.

This was just sunscreen use according to the author of the paper and the 92 year old in the picture. 

Pretty insane to see, but this may be the power of consistent habits and simplicity (just protect yourself!). 

Entitled to think the pic is fake (as many derms say there’s no way this is just spf) but from the writer and the woman herself, that’s speculation.

Don’t disagree that there may be something else going on—but the narrative and misinformation that spread as a result? Let’s just say it’s fascinating. Maybe she had something (the answers range from all sorts of lasers to phenol to face lifts)? Maybe she lived in a hat. Maybe she isn’t lying? We don’t know!

I’ll let y’all know how my laser goes 🫠

Happy skincare buying!

And the fresh water used in agriculture 👀 I’ll stop making this argument when people stop taking it in bad faith. The beauty industry absolutely greenwashes. The sales pitch that if you buy something you’re helping the environment absolutely exists. And if you’ve ever read an interview by me I cringe when people ask ‘how is Dieux sustainable?’

The irony of petrolatum is it’s demonized in marketing TO SELL YOU MORE STUFF.

Yes it’s a byproduct of the fossil fuel industry. 

But when your plant alternatives use the main thing, fossil fuels, to be grown, refined processed and shipped all over the world to then be shipped for final production… are you really so sure petrolatum is worse?

Again, no one is saying petrolatum is great for the environment, what I’m saying is no one has shown it’s worse (and at trade shows many suppliers confirmed my suspicions on how plants are hugely taxing and use so many fossil fuels).

Consumption in many industries (tech, fashion, cpg, wellness) isn’t good for the environment. What all brands should be doing is looking critically at packaging and formulas and life cycle analyses— and from there try to reduce harm and look for innovation in service of that goal. 

If we all did that, emissions and waste would go down and that’s a good thing. If you don’t like beauty and don’t want to use beauty then not buying anything is also an option. I hope you’re equally loud on politics and not just yelling at people who use beauty. Every industry needs to get their sh*t together.

This is also why I vote for politicians that care about the environment. Furious that the inflation reduction act makes concessions for fossil fuel industry BUT there are great bits on agriculture. I’m excited to see where that goes because in the future maybe plants will be better than petrolatum… till then… please stop with the bad faith arguments.

Walking down the street in Williamsburg I heard 2 women breaking down skin cycling 🔁 what is it?

It’s a routine that preaches what many derms and estheticians do: don’t go wild with your routine, respect your barrier. How it works:

🌙 Night time routine 
1️⃣ first day: exfoliate
2️⃣ 2nd day: Vitamin A (retinol)
3️⃣4️⃣ next two days? Rest

Then you repeat.

Revolutionary? No. Incredibly helpful if you’re confused by the insanity of the internet? Oui madame. 

@drwhitneybowe coined the term and making restraint go viral? Into it.

After working at Snapchat during the 2016 election and having worked in media for years—it’s déjà vu. A horrifying, when will we learn if we want to save ourselves déjà vu.

Don’t talk about my past careers much but the reality is you do need to be wary of what you see online, especially as people can sound authoritative and convincing despite having zero knowledge or experience. I’m not a fan of saying do your own research (are we qualified to read/understand these reports) but I will say… find experts and see what they say. And if you’re outraged… I always question the content (sometimes it’s right, many times it’s not).

It’s a big motivator for why I work in beauty. I see how often misinformation and fear lead trends and… we don’t have to be like this.

Always important to know how things work, hope this helps! ♥️

Stuck ring? Finger saving video! 💍 

When crush injuries happen to the hand, swelling can occur quickly, cutting off circulation to the finger. If this happens, you MUST remove the ring quickly to save the finger

1. Putting the hand in ice water can reduce the swelling 
2. Try soap, Vaseline, or windex to lubricate the finger and twist the ring off.
3. Jewelers and EMS can try cutting the ring off but certain metals, like tungsten, cannot be cut
4. Dental floss or tourniquet technique (seen in the video) is a common emergency room trick to get a ring off

Turns out, that hydrogen peroxide actually delays wound healing

It’s best to just use soap and warm water to clean wounds. If you need an antiseptic, choose chlorhexidine 

Truth be told, alcohol actually burns more

Exfoliate 101 🔬 

Glycolic: Most effective exfoliant, meant for normal skin

Salicylic: Penetrates pores and dissolved in oil. Great for acne and oily skin

Lactic: Moisturizes and exfoliates simultaneously. Meant for dry skin

Mandelic / PHA: Large particle, doesn’t penetrate as deep. Makes it great for sensitive skin types 

Many products combine these ingredients, so this is just a rough starter for those who don’t know which one to begin with!

Rib injuries can be super painful and dangerous 

Displaced fractures can injure the the lungs leading to bruising or pneumothorax. If the lower ribs are involved, the spleen and liver can be injured

Most rib fractures heal without surgery but pain control and deep breathing are important to prevent atelectasis. The most common complication is pneumonia because people don’t breathe deep enough after due to the pain!

Canker Sores 😣 

Causes include stress, vitamin deficiencies, SLS in toothpaste, acidic foods, autoimmune conditions, and infections 

Most of the time, we have no idea why they happen but they’re a pain when they do

Treatments:
• Rinse with salt water
• Numbing gels 
• Topical steroids (prescribed)

Some studies show that sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) in toothpaste can contribute! So consider looking for a toothpaste without this ingredient

Severe Acne Treatment 💊 

Original creator: @daisyycbj 

Nodulocystic acne is extremely painful and leads to permanent scarring if not treated aggressively. You should act quickly to avoid long term issues 

Unfortunately, this type of acne does not respond to topical medications. Isotretinoin (formerly known as accutane) is the most effective treatment for this condition. It treats the 4 main causes of acne in a single pill and no other skincare routine (other than moisturizer & sunscreen) is needed while on it 

Side effects include:
• super dry skin and dry lips 
• headaches
• vision changes 
• mood changes
• liver injury
• muscle and joint pain

Most importantly, it can cause birth defects if you get pregnant while taking it and for one month after. However, it doesn’t cause long term issues with fertility!

Your derm will monitor side effects, check a pregnancy test monthly, and weigh the risks + benefits to decide if it’s the right treatment for you

That being said, the medication is LIFE CHANGING for many people! 70-80% of people never get acne again
